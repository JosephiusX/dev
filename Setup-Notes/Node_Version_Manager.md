# Node Version Manager

first we need to uninstall our regular node installation.

find nvm on github

    https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

    find nvm setup.exe in the assets

    download it(did it in C drive last time)

test if everything works

    in bash "nvm list" should return " no installations recognized"
